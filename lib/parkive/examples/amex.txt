Payments: Your payment must be sent to the payment address shown on
your statement and must be received by 5 p.m. local time at that address to
be credited as of the day it is received. Payments we receive after 5 p.m. will
not be credited to your Account until the next day. Payments must also: (1)
include the remittance coupon from your statement; (2) be made with a
single check drawn on a US bank and payable in US dollars, or with a
negotiable instrument payable in US dollars and clearable through the US
banking system; and (3) include your Account number. If your payment
does not meet all of the above requirements, crediting may be delayed and
you may incur late payment fees and additional interest charges. Electronic
payments must be made through an electronic payment method payable
in US dollars and clearable through the US banking system. Please do not
send post-dated checks as they will be deposited upon receipt. Any
restrictive language on a payment we accept will have no effect on us
without our express prior written approval. We will re-present to your
financial institution any payment that is returned unpaid.
Permission for Electronic Withdrawal: (1) When you send a check for
payment, you give us permission to electronically withdraw your payment
from your deposit or other asset account. We will process checks
electronically by transmitting the amount of the check, routing number,
account number and check serial number to your financial institution,
unless the check is not processable electronically or a less costly process is
available. When we process your check electronically, your payment may
be withdrawn from your deposit or other asset account as soon as the same
day we receive your check, and you will not receive that cancelled check
with your deposit or other asset account statement. If we cannot collect the
funds electronically we may issue a draft against your deposit or other asset
account for the amount of the check. (2) By using Pay By Computer, Pay By
Phone or any other electronic payment service of ours, you give us
permission to electronically withdraw funds from the deposit or other asset
account you specify in the amount you request. Payments using such
services of ours received after 8:00 p.m. MST may not be credited until the
next day.
How We Calculate Your Balance: We use the Average Daily Balance (ADB)
method (including new transactions) to calculate the balance on which we
charge interest on your Account. Call the Customer Care number on page 3
for more information about this balance computation method and how
resulting interest charges are determined. The method we use to figure the
ADB and interest results in daily compounding of interest.
Paying Interest: Your due date is at least 25 days after the close of each
billing period. We will not charge you interest on your purchases if you pay
each month your entire balance (or Adjusted Balance if applicable) by the
due date each month. We will charge you interest on cash advances and
(unless otherwise disclosed) balance transfers beginning on the transaction
date.
Foreign Currency Charges: If you make a Charge in a foreign currency, we
will convert it into US dollars on the date we or our agents process it. We
will choose a conversion rate that is acceptable to us for that date, unless a
particular rate is required by law. The conversion rate we use is no more
than the highest official rate published by a government agency or the
highest interbank rate we identify from customary banking sources on the
conversion date or the prior business day. This rate may differ from rates in
effect on the date of your charge. Charges converted by establishments
(such as airlines) will be billed at the rates such establishments use.
Credit Balance: A credit balance (designated CR) shown on this statement
represents money owed to you. If within the six-month period following

the date of the first statement indicating the credit balance you do not
request a refund or charge enough to use up the credit balance, we will
send you a check for the credit balance within 30 days if the amount is
$1.00 or more.
Credit Reporting: We may report information about your Account to credit
bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your
Account may be reflected in your credit report.
What To Do If You Think You Find A Mistake On Your Statement
If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at:
American Express, PO Box 981535, El Paso TX 79998-1535
You may also contact us on the Web: www.americanexpress.com
In your letter, give us the following information:
- Account information: Your name and account number.
- Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error.
- Description of Problem: If you think there is an error on your bill,
describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.
You must contact us within 60 days after the error appeared on your
statement.
You must notify us of any potential errors in writing [or electronically]. You
may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential
errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error, the following
are true:
- We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as
delinquent on that amount.
- The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may
continue to charge you interest on that amount. But, if we determine that
we made a mistake, you will not have to pay the amount in question or any
interest or other fees related to that amount.
- While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible
for the remainder of your balance.
- We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.
Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased
with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the
problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the
remaining amount due on the purchase.
To use this right, all of the following must be true:
1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100
miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have
been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these is necessary if your purchase
was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the
company that sold you the goods or services.)
2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made
with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit
card account do not qualify.
3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.
If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the
purchase, contact us in writing or electronically at:
American Express, PO Box 981535, El Paso TX 79998-1535
www.americanexpress.com
While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as
discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our
decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay
we may report you as delinquent.
